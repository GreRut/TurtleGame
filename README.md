# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

Welcome to the **Turtle Racing Game**! 🎮 In this fun and interactive Python project, you will bet on a turtle and watch it race against others to the finish line. Will your turtle win? 🏆

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is simple: 
1. Pick a turtle from the available colors.
2. Watch the turtles race across the screen.
3. See if your chosen turtle reaches the finish line first!

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Place Your Bet**: 
   - When prompted, enter the color of the turtle you think will win.
   - The colors are: 
     - 🟥 `red`
     - 🟧 `orange`
     - 🟨 `yellow`
     - 🟩 `green`
     - 🟦 `blue`
     - 🟪 `purple`
   
2. **Start the Race**: 
   - The turtles will begin moving as soon as you place your bet. 
   - Each turtle moves randomly with varying speeds.

3. **Win or Lose**: 
   - If your turtle crosses the finish line first, you'll get a victory message! 🎉
   - If not, better luck next time! 😅

## 🛠️ Code Overview

- **Turtle Setup**: 
   - We use the `turtle` library to create and manage the race.
   - Six turtles are created with unique colors and starting positions.
   
- **Bet Input**: 
   - A dialog box allows you to enter your bet on which turtle will win the race.

- **Race Logic**:
